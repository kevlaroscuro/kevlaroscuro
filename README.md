### Hi everyone!!! ðŸ‘‹

This is a prototype of my readme file.

At first, thanks to visit my profile. It's only a 

My name is Juan Carlos, but everyone call me **Kevlar**. I'm a 30 years old spanish studient who is trying to give a round to her life and give a chance to do something new.

I'm informatician, Hardware Specialist, but I never continue in this line, I fall the in laboral world about 2015 and I never work in something I like. So this is my oportunity to probe myself. Thanks to listen my history. Please, your free to send me a message to colaborate wiht me, or if you need a hand I'll do my best to help.

If you see my avatar photo, I'm military historic reenactor and I like this world, and I like the motor world too (bikes, cars, trucks,... whatever!)

This is all for now, I'll continue to do better. So please be patient, and sorry for my horrible english.

See you my friend!!!
